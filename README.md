# GroupChatProject

This repo contains programs to implement an online chat server.

* ChatServer.java runs the server by listening to clients and handling connections
* ChatClient.java handles keyboard input from the client
* ChatClientHandler.java takes the client's message and sends to other clients
* ChatClientListener.java gets and displays messages from the server
