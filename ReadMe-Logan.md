I am responsible for creating the chat server and client based on the chat assignment from earlier in the year.
I also integrated the client code into the gui to work with button clicks as well as display to the message boxes
I helped with error fixing as well as aided slightly with the ui design.
I am currently working on getting the netbeans partition to correctly multithread when connected with another client on the server.
