Code Reviewer:

On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of 4 based on the following criteria:

1  The documentation is insufficient to enable me to compile the project, or at least one of the program has syntax errors and does not compile

2  The programs compile successfully but at least one generates runtime errors

3  The programs compile and run but the project does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results.
Specifically:

4  The programs compile and produce technically correct results but does not produce the deliverables specified in the documentation for the submission or is insufficiently documented.
Specifically:
Documentation is needed, ie: more comments in the code, as well as instructions to users on how to run the program after typing in a username. Instructions on how to run the GUI would be nice too, and also instructions on how to quit the program.

5  The program produces correct output, produces all of the specified deliverables, and is well written and well documented
